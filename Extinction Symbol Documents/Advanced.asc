The parameters below can be used to affect the execution time of the program (with a 
corresponding effect on the accuracy of the calculated numbers) and to possibly modify 
the input data file if required 

MODIFY INPUT DATA FILE
----------------------
1.0         'increase error'   			(explanation see +)


ADJUST EXECUTION SPEED AND ACCURACY OF CALCULATED NUMBERS
--------------------------------------------------------
40          'correlation cutoff' value			(explanation see *)
100000      'max Monte Carlo iterations'        (explanation see **)
2           'tolerance'							(explanation see **)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Short explanation to parameters: (see "manual.doc" for more details)


+     multiply the standard deviations from the input data file by this number
      (i.e. the square root of the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix)


*     the 'correlation cutoff' value is a threshold value. This number must be between
      0 and 100 and represent a percentage. If the correction between two intensities is less than 
      this number then the program defines two neighboring peaks to be uncorrelated and vice versa.  


**    When correlation is present between peaks the Monte Carlo integration technique is executed. 
      'max Monte Carlo iterations' is the maximum number of Monte Carlo iteration steps which can be 
      executed to bring the accuracy below 'tolerance', where 'tolerance' is the last input parameter 
      in this file. Like 'correlation cutoff', 'tolerance' represent a percentage value.
