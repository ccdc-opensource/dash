     Introduction

     DASH Version 2.2 is a full release of DASH which includes bug
     fixes and new features.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     System Requirements and Installation

     DASH runs under Windows 98, Me, NT4, 2000 and XP. DASH is not
     supported on Intel 486, 586, original Pentium, AMD K6, and Cyrix
     processors. These processors are approximately 10 years old. CCDC
     have asked COMPAQ for advice on compiler settings in an attempt to
     remedy this situation.

     PLEASE NOTE: DASH 2.2 will be the last release to be supported 
     on Windows 98, 98SE and NT4.

     Double-click on the file that you have just downloaded and follow
     the on-screen instructions for installation. You will be given the
     option to install DASH and Mercury. It is recommended that Mercury 
     (Version 1.0 or above) is installed for crystal structure 
     visualisation with DASH. You do not need to install Mercury if you 
     have already installed it as part of the CSD System, or downloaded 
     it from the CCDC website.

     If installing on Windows NT, 2000 or XP, administrator privileges
     are recommended but not usually required.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     Licensing

     In order to run DASH, post-purchase, you will need a licence key
     which can be obtained from admin@ccdc.cam.ac.uk. Instructions
     for obtaining this appear when the program is started.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     New Features

     DASH 2.2 contains a number of additional features and improvements 
     over its predecessor including the ability to use modal torsion 
     angle ranges and an integrated rigid body Rietveld refinement. 
     Full documentation and tutorials are also provided on the new 
     features.

     The DASH executable has been recompiled and optimised so that it 
     will now run faster on all supported platforms.

     The time taken for a DASH run is now reported in a pop-up window 
     after structure solution has run to completion.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     Documentation

     The DASH User Guide and tutorials are provided in the
     Documentation sub-directory of the installation directory. An
     example file is also provided in the Example sub-directory of the
     installation directory.

     It is recommended that new users work through the tutorials before
     using DASH for the first time. This information can also be
     accessed via the graphical user interface.
